ServiceNow JavaScript API Libraries
http://lib.snc.guru/

Hi! I'm Tim Woodruff, of SN Pro Tips; author of Learning ServiceNow and The ServiceNow Development Handbook. This ServiceNow JavaScript API library was adapted from something that Garrett Griffin put together in 2014. I found the libraries so massively useful, that I decided to build upon, add to, and update them throughout the last several years (with permission from Garrett) in order to make developing ServiceNow-centric code in my local IDE a lot easier. While I've done a lot of work on this over the last few years, most of the credit must surely go to Garrett for his hard work in starting this out. 
Thanks, Garrett!
